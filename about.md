I work in Professor Dominic Kwiatkowski's group at the [Welcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics](www.well.ox.ac.uk) in Oxford, as part of the [MalariaGEN](http://www.malariagen.net/) project. 

I work on the genetics of malaria vectors, specifically on the *Anopheles gambiae* 1000 Genomes project, trying to answer questions on the level of diversity in wild vector populations and the effects of insecticide pressure on vector genomes.
